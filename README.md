# cpp_GalaxyMapper
Reads in coordinate data for each solar system in EVE's New Eden galaxy and plots it on a window.

Dependencies: SFML 2.3.2

Wow, was this one a PITA. I spent more time debugging why SFML::RenderWindow crashed on constructor call than writing the program.

Anyway, sample image: https://github.com/caeruleus1F/cpp_GalaxyMapper/blob/master/cpp_GalaxyMapper/Galaxy_Map.jpg
